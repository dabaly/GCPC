## 🚧 Projects
Documentation of various projects completed under the GCPC with Screenshots and reports for visual representation.

### 🧰 Security Tool Usage
#### 🔹 Python Projects: 
These are beginner Python codes that I wrote as I was learning Python basics from the GCPC. The code is written using Jupyter notebooks while the scenarios and 
questions are part of the GCPC Python course. The course teaches Python from a security analyst's view hence most of the activities and scenarios are created to emulate
an analyst's actions.
