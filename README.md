### 🛡️ SECURITY OPERATIONS
#### 🔹 Security Audit: 
SCENARIO
Botium Toys is a small fictional U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location, which serves as its main office, a storefront, and a warehouse for its products. However, Botium Toy’s online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide. 
The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She's worried about maintaining compliance and business operations as the company grows without a clear plan. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to internally processing and accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).   
The IT manager starts by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, listing assets currently managed by the IT department, and completing a risk assessment. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks and/or fines that the company might experience due to the current state of its security posture.
My task was to review the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment report. Then, perform an internal audit by completing a controls and compliance checklist and writing recommendations

#### 🔹 Asset Management and Risk Assessment: 
This activity's aim was to practice performing a risk assessment by evaluating vulnerabilities that commonly threaten business operations. This helps decide how to prioritize resources based on the risk scores each vulnerability is assigned.
The sample Home accessory inventory includes all the devices in the person's home office and other items in the house.

#### 🔹 Security Audit:
SCENARIO  
There is an educational technology company that developed an application to help teachers automatically grade assignments. The application handles a wide range of data that it collects from academic institutions, instructors, parents, and students. My team was alerted to a data leak of internal business plans on social media. An investigation by the team discovered that an employee accidentally shared those confidential documents with an external business partner. An audit into the leak is underway to determine how similar incidents can be avoided.
A supervisor provided me with information regarding the leak. It appears that the principle of least privilege was not observed by employees at the company during a sales meeting. I have been asked to analyze the situation and find ways to prevent it from happening again.

#### 🔹 Threat Modelling using the PASTA Framework:
SCENARIO  
I'm part of the growing security team at a company for sneaker enthusiasts and collectors. The business is preparing to launch a mobile app that makes it easy for its customers to buy and sell shoes. 
I am performing a threat model of the application using the PASTA framework.

### 🧰 SECURITY TOOLS
#### 🔹 Python Projects: 
These are beginner Python codes that I wrote as I was learning Python basics from the GCPC. The code is written using Jupyter notebooks while the scenarios and 
questions are part of the GCPC Python course. The course teaches Python from a security analyst's view hence most of the activities and scenarios are created to emulate
an analyst's actions.
